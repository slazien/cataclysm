# Killer Features for Cataclysm: Research-Backed Trackday Demo Plan

*Synthesized from 3 parallel research agents covering competitive landscape, AI coaching innovations, and social/viral mechanics. February 2026.*

---

## Executive Summary: The 3 Highest-Impact Demo Features

1. **Shareable Session Cards** — Auto-generated social media cards (Spotify Wrapped model, 500M+ shares proven). Every share is a free billboard. Zero effort from user. No motorsport tool does this.

2. **"Time Gained" per Corner** — Golf's Strokes Gained applied to motorsport. Arccos Golf proves this concept converts amateurs. "You're leaving 0.4s on the table at Turn 5" is infinitely more actionable than a speed trace. NO motorsport tool implements this.

3. **F1-TV Mini-Sector Gain/Loss Map** — Color-coded track map answering "where am I slow?" in 2 seconds. The most intuitive visualization possible. F1 broadcasts prove the concept at scale; zero consumer tools bring it to HPDE.

**The killer paddock moment**: *"Upload your session and let's compare — the AI will tell us both where we're losing time."* This combines AI coaching (unique), comparison (forces the friend to install), and social dynamics (friendly competition).

## 2. Community Pain Points (From Forums)

**Sources:** [Rennlist HPDE Data Logging](https://rennlist.com/forums/racing-and-drivers-education-forum/1241483-data-logging-apps-for-hpde-2.html) | [GRM Telemetry for Dummies](https://grassrootsmotorsports.com/forum/grm/telemetry-for-dummies/183230/page1/) | [GRM How Do You Record](https://grassrootsmotorsports.com/forum/grm/how-do-you-record-your-track-day-data/262354/page1/) | [ProdRacing Catalyst 2](https://prodracing.com/threads/garmin-catalyst-2.20214/) | [HP Academy](https://www.hpacademy.com/technical-articles/going-faster-with-data-analysis/) | [Rennlist Best Data Logger](https://rennlist.com/forums/996-forum/1371234-best-track-day-data-logger.html)

### Pain Point 1: "I have no idea how to interpret my data"
The #1 complaint. Drivers buy logging equipment, collect data, then stare at squiggly lines. "Had no effing idea how to use it." Need "race engineer level knowledge" to extract value.
> **Cataclysm answer:** AI coaching that translates data into plain English. "Brake 15m earlier into Turn 5" beats "here's a speed vs distance graph."

### Pain Point 2: Multi-device setup complexity
Phone + GPS + OBD dongle + power cords + mount + camera = "a pain." RAM mounts flying off during hot laps (safety hazard). Bluetooth disconnects.
> **Cataclysm answer:** Software-only solution working with a single GPS device.

### Pain Point 3: Video/data sync is broken
"The latency or lag of data rendered in video is so much that information is useless." GoPro integration constantly breaking.
> **Cataclysm answer:** Focus on data analysis first. Animated track replays replace video overlay.

### Pain Point 4: Apps break with OS updates
Harry's Lap Timer "reliability issues." Porsche Track Precision App "extremely unreliable."
> **Cataclysm answer:** Web-based platform immune to mobile OS breakage.

### Pain Point 5: Subscription fatigue
Garmin Vault $9.99/month, Apex Pro $678/year. Users hate recurring fees on top of hardware costs.
> **Cataclysm answer:** Generous free tier with pay-per-use AI coaching.

### Pain Point 6: No unified ecosystem
AIM, RaceChrono, TrackAddict data don't talk to each other. Sharing with coach requires exporting files and emailing.
> **Cataclysm answer:** Cloud platform importing from multiple sources with easy sharing.

### Pain Point 7: Gadgets before fundamentals
Multiple experienced drivers advise "get instruction FIRST." Beginners get overwhelmed with raw data.
> **Cataclysm answer:** AI coaching acts as instructor first (fundamentals), before raw data. Progressive disclosure.

## 3. Killer Features Ranked (15 Features, 3 Tiers)

### Tier 1: Build for Trackday Demo (High Impact + Feasible Now)

#### 1. Shareable Session Cards
**What it is:** Auto-generated social media cards (9:16 vertical for Instagram/TikTok) with track map, racing line, best lap time, improvement delta, key stats, AI coaching headline. ONE TAP to share. Says "Analyzed by Cataclysm" with branding.

**Why it's compelling:** Spotify Wrapped proved 500M+ shares in one day. Every share is a free billboard. PrestoSports creates infographics in seconds from live data. No motorsport tool generates shareable visual content automatically.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 NUCLEAR — zero-effort sharing, every card is a free ad

**Implementation complexity:** MEDIUM — Canvas/SVG rendering to image, existing D3 charts as source, share via Web Share API. Frontend-only feature building on existing visualization infrastructure.

**Sources:** [Spotify Wrapped 2025](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-wrapped/) | [Spotify Wrapped Marketing Strategy](https://nogood.io/blog/spotify-wrapped-marketing-strategy/)

---

#### 2. "Time Gained" per Corner (Strokes Gained for Motorsport)
**What it is:** Golf's "Strokes Gained" metric (invented by Columbia professor Mark Broadie) applied to motorsport. Compare each corner's time to YOUR average and to other drivers at your skill level. Rank corners by "where you're leaving the most time on the table." Show delta in seconds per corner.

**Why it's compelling:** Arccos Golf (500M shot database) proves this transforms how amateurs improve. Shot Scope's Strokes Gained gives golfers the single most actionable metric in their sport. "You lose 0.3s at Turn 5 vs. your average" and "0.8s vs. drivers at your level." **NO motorsport tool implements this.** Genuine first-mover advantage.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 EXTREME — creates conversation ("I'm leaving half a second at Turn 5!")

**Implementation complexity:** LOW-MEDIUM — Cataclysm already computes per-corner times, delta-T, and corner detection. The math is: `time_gained[corner] = corner_time[this_lap] - corner_time[best_lap]`. Ranking corners by impact is a sort. The infrastructure exists.

**Sources:** [Arccos Review 2025](https://goinglow.com/arccos-golf-review-2025/) | [Shot Scope Strokes Gained](https://shotscope.com/us/discover/features/strokes-gained/) | [GolfDigest](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/new-stat-tracking-features-from-arccos--shot-scope-make-you-smar)

---

#### 3. Brake Fade & Tire Degradation Detection
**What it is:** Automated detection of brake fade (decreasing peak deceleration across laps at the same braking zone) and tire degradation (speed loss in the same corner over consecutive laps, increasing braking distances, reduced cornering g). Alert: "Brake fade detected at Turn 5 starting lap 8 — peak braking dropped from 1.1g to 0.8g." "Your tires fell off at lap N."

**Why it's compelling:** **No consumer tool does this automatically.** All derivable from GPS speed data alone (decel = delta_v / delta_t). Research on F1 tyre energy prediction exists (ArXiv 2025) but nothing at the consumer level. Genuinely novel automated feature.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 EXTREME — safety-relevant, immediately actionable, impressive technical depth

**Implementation complexity:** MEDIUM — Requires tracking per-corner metrics across all laps in a session and detecting trends. The corner detection and per-corner KPI extraction already exists. Need: trend analysis layer comparing corner N across laps 1..M.

**Sources:** [ArXiv: Tyre Energy Prediction in F1](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.04067v1) | [Coach Dave: Brake Traces](https://coachdaveacademy.com/tutorials/a-delta-guide-understanding-brake-traces-to-be-faster/) | [HP Academy: Braking Data Analysis](https://www.hpacademy.com/previous-webinars/286-how-to-analyse-braking-data/)

---

#### 4. F1-TV Mini-Sector Gain/Loss Map
**What it is:** Divide track into 10-20 mini-sectors. Color-code each on the track map: green (personal best), purple (session best), yellow (slower). Show "gain/loss bar" per sector. Answers "where am I slow?" visually in 2 seconds.

**Why it's compelling:** F1 TV translates 1.1 million data points per car into intuitive real-time graphics. Race Trace and MultiViewer prove the concept works for engaged fans. The gap: no amateur tool brings broadcast-quality mini-sector visualization to HPDE drivers.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 EXTREME — the most intuitive visualization possible, immediately understood by any driver

**Implementation complexity:** LOW — Track is already resampled in distance domain. Divide into N equal segments, compute time per segment per lap, color-code on existing track map component. D3.js track map already exists.

**Sources:** [MultiViewer: Race Trace](https://multiviewer.app/docs/usage/race-trace) | [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org/) | [The Race: F1 Broadcast HQ](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/behind-the-scenes-most-advanced-sport-broadcast-hq-f1/)

---

#### 5. Voice-Narrated Session Summary
**What it is:** Press play and hear your AI coaching report read aloud. "Your best lap was a 1:45.2, half a second faster than last session. Turn 5 was your biggest gain — you braked 8 meters later and carried 3 more mph through the apex. Focus area for next session: Turn 3 entry speed."

**Why it's compelling:** Web Speech API is free, works in all modern browsers, zero cost. trophi.ai's "Mansell AI" real-time voice coaching sets user expectations. 157M+ voice assistant users in US. ACM study ("From Dashboards to Dialogue", 2025) found conversational AI coaching rated more useful and satisfying than dashboards.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥 HIGH — huge "wow" factor in person, "my app talks to me about my driving"

**Implementation complexity:** LOW — Web Speech API (SpeechSynthesis) is ~10 lines of JS. The coaching report text already exists from Claude AI. Wire the existing text to the browser's speech engine.

**Sources:** [MDN: Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API) | [ACM: From Dashboards to Dialogue](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3744333.3747811) | [trophi.ai](https://www.trophi.ai/sim-racing-coaching)

---

### Tier 2: Engagement Multipliers (Build Next)

#### 6. 5-Minute Pit Lane Debrief
**What it is:** Single-screen mobile-optimized summary for between sessions. Hero card (best lap + delta), top 3 corners where you lost the most time, consistency score, ONE coaching tip for next session. Auto-generated on CSV upload.

**Why it's compelling:** Garmin Catalyst 2 shows top 3 improvements after every session. RaceCapture offers "instantly review laps right as you come off track." Drivers have 30-60 minutes between run groups standing around with phones — this is the perfect content for that moment.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥 HIGH — conversation starter, shows well on a phone

**Implementation complexity:** LOW — Curate existing data into a single responsive card view. All data already computed.

---

#### 7. Corner Leaderboards / KOC (King of Corner)
**What it is:** Every auto-detected corner becomes a micro-leaderboard. Filter by car class, experience level, track conditions. "King of the Corner" for fastest apex speed or best corner time.

**Why it's compelling:** Strava Segments: "There are two eras of endurance sport history: before segments, and after segments." The dopamine loop of chasing segment times brings users back daily. This is what drivers already argue about in the paddock, but with no data to back it up.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 EXTREME — "I'm the KOM of Turn 5" creates instant engagement

**Implementation complexity:** MEDIUM — Requires user accounts + cross-session corner matching + leaderboard backend. Corner detection and per-corner KPIs already exist.

**Sources:** [Trophy: Strava Gamification Case Study](https://trophy.so/blog/strava-gamification-case-study) | [Strava Segments](https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2025/11/18/inside-the-cyclists-mind-the-dopamine-trap-of-chasing-strava-segments/)

---

#### 8. Season Wrapped / Year in Review
**What it is:** Annual personalized recap: total laps, miles, tracks visited, best improvement, corners mastered, AI coaching insights, "driving personality" from telemetry. 9:16 vertical format. ONE TAP to share.

**Why it's compelling:** Strava's 2025 Wrapped: 500M+ shares within first day (41% increase YoY). 200M+ Spotify Wrapped users in 24 hours. Non-users feel excluded, driving installs. Proven viral mechanic at massive scale.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 NUCLEAR — every share is a free billboard, FOMO drives installs

**Implementation complexity:** MEDIUM — Requires aggregating multi-session data, generating visual cards, share flow. Seasonal — build for end of track season.

**Sources:** [Strava Year in Sport](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/22067973274509-Your-Year-in-Sport) | [Spotify Wrapped 2025](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-wrapped/) | [TechCrunch Wrapped](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/spotify-says-wrapped-2025-is-its-biggest-yet-with-200m-users-in-its-first-day/)

---

#### 9. Driver-to-Driver Comparison Sharing
**What it is:** Upload session → get shareable comparison link → friend uploads their session → both see overlay analysis with AI coaching comparing their styles.

**Why it's compelling:** The comparison feature is INHERENTLY multi-user. Every comparison request is an install request. The viral loop: Driver A → tells Driver B "upload yours" → Driver B installs → both compare → both share → C and D install.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 EXTREME — forces friend to install (built-in viral loop)

**Implementation complexity:** MEDIUM — Extend existing delta analysis to work across users. Needs shareable session links and cross-user matching.

---

#### 10. Skill Radar Chart
**What it is:** Four dimensions (Braking, Trail Braking, Throttle Application, Line Accuracy) tracked over time. Reveals "driving personality." Inspired by Wahoo cycling's 4DP Power Breakdown.

**Why it's compelling:** Gives drivers a visual identity. "I'm a strong braker but my throttle application needs work." Tracked over sessions to show improvement. Creates a shareable visual that's instantly understood.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥 HIGH — visually impressive, conversation starter

**Implementation complexity:** MEDIUM — Derive 4 skill dimensions from existing per-corner KPIs. Radar chart is a standard D3 component.

**Sources:** [Wahoo 4DP](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/29868373177746-Wahoo-cycling-Fitness-Metrics-explained)

---

### Tier 3: Future Differentiators

#### 11. Heart Rate Overlay (Apple Watch / WHOOP)
**What it is:** Overlay heart rate on speed trace. Show "stress zones" on track map. "Your HR spiked to 165bpm entering Turn 5, correlating with your 0.3s time loss."

**Why it's compelling:** F1 drivers run 140-170bpm. Consumer wearables now capture this. No HPDE tool overlays biometric data with telemetry. Inherently shareable — "Look at my heart rate in the corkscrew!"

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥 HIGH

**Implementation complexity:** MEDIUM-HIGH — Apple Health / WHOOP API integration, time-sync with GPS data.

**Sources:** [TrailBrake: HR Monitoring](https://trailbrake.com/data-analysis-tips/monitoring-driver-core-temp-and-heart-rate/) | [F1 Biometric Gloves](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/02/241326/f1-drivers-are-getting-biometric-gloves-to-monitor-their-vitals-this-year/)

---

#### 12. Instructor Dashboard (B2B Distribution)
**What it is:** HPDE instructors see all student sessions, flag students needing attention, annotate coaching notes. AI does first-pass analysis, instructor adds human insight on top.

**Why it's compelling:** 1 instructor = 20-30 installs per event. Instructor recommendation carries enormous trust. Griiip already targets this market with hardware; Cataclysm can do it software-only. Instructors who look brilliant because of Cataclysm will evangelize it.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 EXTREME (distribution multiplier)

**Implementation complexity:** HIGH — Needs instructor roles, student linking, multi-user views.

**Sources:** [NASA Speed News Teaching Tools](https://nasaspeed.news/toolshed-engineer/tools-for-teaching/) | [Griiip NJMP](https://njmp.com/the-njmp-to-implement-griiip-products-to-enhance-both-driver-performance-and-fan-experience-in-2026/)

---

#### 13. HPDE Org Clubs (NASA/SCCA/PCA Partnerships)
**What it is:** Organizations get "clubs" with org-branded session cards, student progression dashboards, run group management. "NASA Southeast presents your session at Barber."

**Why it's compelling:** Strava clubs nearly quadrupled to 1M in 2025. 55% of Gen Z named social connection as top reason for joining. This is the Strava distribution playbook: grow through organizations. If an org adopts Cataclysm, every student installs it.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 EXTREME (B2B wedge)

**Implementation complexity:** HIGH — Needs org accounts, student management, branded assets.

**Sources:** [Strava Clubs](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918347-Clubs-on-Strava) | [Community Growth at Strava](https://community.inc/deep-dives/community-growth-strava)

---

#### 14. Achievement/Badge System
**What it is:** Gamification badges: "Consistency King" (10 laps within 0.5s), "Brake Master" (perfect trail braking score), "Track Rat" (50+ laps at one track), "Glass Ceiling Breaker" (broke a plateau), "Coaching Disciple" (10 AI reports read).

**Why it's compelling:** Gamification boosts engagement 150%. 75% of users stay motivated by gamified apps. Peloton's system drives daily retention. Rewards dedication, not just raw speed — critical for HPDE culture.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥 MEDIUM

**Implementation complexity:** LOW-MEDIUM — Badge logic on existing metrics, badge display UI.

**Sources:** [Nudge: Gamify Fitness Apps](https://www.nudgenow.com/blogs/gamify-your-fitness-apps) | [Club Peloton Gamification](https://www.pelobuddy.com/gamification-loyatly-app-coming/)

---

#### 15. Animated Lap Replay
**What it is:** D3.js dot tracing the racing line with synchronized speed gauge, g-force display, and throttle/brake bars. Exportable as MP4 for social sharing via canvas recording.

**Why it's compelling:** iRacing/sim racing overlay tools (ATVO, RaceLab, Apex Boss) set the visual standard. An animated replay that doesn't need video is unique. Exportable as social content.

**Paddock viral potential:** 🔥🔥🔥 HIGH — visually impressive, share-worthy

**Implementation complexity:** MEDIUM-HIGH — D3 animation exists conceptually. Canvas recording to MP4 needs MediaRecorder API. Synchronized multi-gauge display.

**Sources:** [ATVO Overlays](https://appgineering.com/en/atvo-broadcast-overlays) | [RaceLab](https://racelab.app/) | [IR Telemetry](https://irtelemetry.com/2025/03/08/introducing-irtelemetry/)

## 4. The "Paddock Moment"

### The Exact Scenario That Makes Someone Install

**Setting:** 30-minute break between run groups at Barber Motorsports Park. Two drivers standing by their cars, both just ran the same session.

**Driver A** (Cataclysm user): *pulls out phone, opens app*

"Look at this — I just uploaded my session and the AI says I'm losing four-tenths at Turn 5 because I'm braking 12 meters too early."

*Shows the F1-style track map with green/yellow/red mini-sectors*

"See? Green everywhere except Turn 5 and the bridge section. My Turn 3 was actually my best ever — purple."

**Driver B**: "That's cool. What app is that?"

**Driver A**: "It's called Cataclysm. Upload your RaceChrono file and we can compare our laps. It'll show us exactly where you're faster than me."

*Driver B installs, uploads. 30 seconds later:*

**The app shows:** Driver B is 0.2s faster through Turn 5 (later braking) but Driver A is 0.4s faster through the esses (better line consistency). The AI coaching says: "Driver B carries 4mph more into Turn 5 apex by trail braking deeper. Driver A maintains more consistent speed through the esses with smoother steering inputs."

**Driver B**: "Holy shit, I had no idea I was that much slower through the esses."

**Driver A**: *hits share* → Instagram story with a branded session card showing the track map, their best lap, and the AI coaching highlight.

**Three more drivers in the paddock see the story. Two of them install before the next session.**

### Why This Scenario Works

1. **Show, don't tell** — the track map visualization is instantly understood
2. **AI coaching is the hook** — no other app tells you WHY you're slow
3. **Comparison forces install** — Driver B MUST install to participate
4. **Shareable content amplifies** — the Instagram story reaches 10x more people
5. **Free tier removes friction** — no $1,200 hardware, no subscription wall
