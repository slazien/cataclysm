# Lessons Learned

## Always Use Venv
- **When**: Every session, before any pip install or running any Python command
- **Rule**: `source .venv/bin/activate` before doing anything. Never install packages globally.
- **Why**: User explicitly requested this. CLAUDE.md now documents the venv requirement.
