  'Trail Braking':
    'Gradually releasing brake pressure while turning in, transferring weight to the front tires for better grip through the corner entry.',
  Apex: 'The innermost point of your line through a corner. Early apex = before geometric center, late apex = after.',
  'Min Speed':
    'Your lowest speed through the corner. Higher min speed = better momentum and faster exit.',
  'Throttle Commit':
    'The point where you go to full throttle on corner exit. Earlier commit (with good technique) = faster lap.',
  'Brake Point':
    'Where you first apply the brakes before a corner. Consistency here is more important than late braking.',
  'Peak Brake G':
    'Maximum deceleration force during braking, measured in G-forces. Higher = harder braking.',
  'Consistency Score':
    'How similar your lap times are to each other. Lower variance = higher consistency = faster overall pace.',
  'Ideal Lap':
    'A theoretical lap combining your best sector times from different laps — the fastest possible if you drove every section perfectly.',
  'Delta-T':
    'Time difference between two laps at each point on track. Negative = faster than reference.',
  'Traction Circle':
    "Visualization of combined lateral and longitudinal G-forces. A fuller circle means you're using more of the tire's grip potential.",
